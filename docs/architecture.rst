Architecture
============

Configuration
-------------
1. Gitignore: local settings 
2. Creating settings module with files for different environments: base, local and production 
3. Creating project documentation with reStructuredText(.rst) files and Sphinx
4. Multiple requirements files

Apps
----
- **Authentication** (built-in django.auth): This app handles user signups, login, and logout
- **Profiles**: this app provides additional user profile information
- **Subvenciones**: subsidies management
- **Parcelas**: parcels management with Google Maps
- **Holidays**: holidays API with excluded days
- **Django Honeypot**: admin security
- **Django Admin Interface**: theme for Django Admin Panel
- **smart-selects**: area-ente selects functionality
- **django-notify-x**: django notification system activity
- **django-markdown-editor**

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Created Login and Signup system in the root project (urls.py, templates, static).

Profiles
^^^^^^^^
When a new user is created, his profile is also created.

Subvenciones
^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Application to manage subsidies.
| Tables:

- Estado
- Colectivo
- Ente
- Area
- Subvencion
- Comment
- Like

Create Subvencion
"""""""""""""""""
| When I create a new subsidie I add admin functionality in my form so I can add new fields suchs as: estado. Its a Django Popup functionality:
| `django-admin-popup-functionality <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2347582/django-admin-popup-functionality>`_


| On the other hand, I insert the comment field into the subvencion form with a formset following this guide:
| `django formset implementation <http://pythonpiura.org/posts/implementando-django-formsets/>`_


| Here for the formset field (contenido) I used markdown editor (added his configuration into settings):
| `Django markdown editor <https://github.com/agusmakmun/django-markdown-editor>`_

In my custom template the editor didn't work as expected so in my base.html I had to add the following urls::

    <link href="{% static 'plugins/css/ace.min.css' %}" type="text/css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="{% static 'plugins/css/semantic.min.css' %}" type="text/css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="{% static 'plugins/css/resizable.min.css' %}" type="text/css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="{% static 'martor/css/martor.min.css' %}" type="text/css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'plugins/js/ace.js' %}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'plugins/js/semantic.min.js' %}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'plugins/js/mode-markdown.js' %}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'plugins/js/ext-language_tools.js' %}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'plugins/js/theme-github.js' %}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'plugins/js/highlight.min.js' %}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'plugins/js/resizable.min.js' %}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'plugins/js/emojis.min.js' %}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'martor/js/martor.min.js' %}"></script>



| Also I follow this guide to add the dropdown functionality for ente and area:
| `Dependent dropdown list <https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/01/29/how-to-implement-dependent-or-chained-dropdown-list-with-django.html>`_

| Datatables functionality to list subvenciones into the index.html

Notify user comment
"""""""""""""""""""
For notifying the comments where user names appear I used this function:

.. code-block:: python

    def markdown_find_mentions(markdown_text, user, object):
        """
        To find the users that mentioned
        on markdown content using `BeautifulShoup`.

        input  : `markdown_text` or markdown content.
        return : `list` of usernames.
        """
        markdownify = import_string(MARTOR_MARKDOWNIFY_FUNCTION)
        mark = markdownify(markdown_text)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(mark, 'html.parser')
        markdown_users = list(set(
            username.text[1::] for username in
            soup.findAll('a', {'class': 'direct-mention-link'})
        ))

        all_users = User.objects.all()
        notify_list_users = []
        for a in all_users:
            if a.username in markdown_users:
                for o in User.objects.all().filter(username=a):
                    notify_list_users.append(o)

        return notify.send(user, recipient_list=list(notify_list_users), actor=user,
                    verb='comentarios', obj=object, target=object,
                    nf_type='mention')

And then in the Created and UpdatedView in the formset:

.. code-block:: python

    comments_formset.save(commit=False)
        for f in comments_formset:
            contenido = f.cleaned_data.get("contenido")
            if contenido:
                # Notify comment
                markdown_find_mentions(self.request.POST['comments-0-contenido'], self.request.user, self.object)
        comments_formset.save()

Filter subvenciones Index
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
For this purpose I used ``django-filter``:

`http://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/install.html <http://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/install.html>`_


Parcelas
^^^^^^^^
Things you can do with this app:

- Find parcels by polygon in my municipality
- Add projects to your town hall (clean forests, roads ...)
- Geolocation

.. note::

    You can download KML related to that parcel

Holidays
^^^^^^^^
When you create or edit subsidie there are two fields: start and end day (datefield). So if you put 13/07/2018 on the start day you will have some extra options such as +10, +20, +30 days. So to avoid holidays and weekends I created this app with Django REST framework (API).

Then in ``create_subvenciones.js`` I get the url with ``$.getJSON`` method.

Django Honeypot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`https://github.com/jamesturk/django-honeypot <https://github.com/jamesturk/django-honeypot>`_

Django Admin Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| `https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/admin-styling/ <https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/admin-styling/>`_
| `https://github.com/fabiocaccamo/django-admin-interface <https://github.com/fabiocaccamo/django-admin-interface>`_
| You can choose your own theme!

smart-select
^^^^^^^^^^^^
| `https://github.com/digi604/django-smart-selects <https://github.com/digi604/django-smart-selects>`_
| I use this app for chaining selects (ente-area)

**Installation**::

    pip install django-smart-selects
    url(r'^chaining/', include('smart_selects.urls')), # into root url's, after admin

**models.py**::

    from smart_selects.db_fields import ChainedForeignKey
    area = ChainedForeignKey(
        Area,
        chained_field="ente",
        chained_model_field="ente",
        show_all=False,
        auto_choose=True,
        sort=True,
        default=''
    )

.. warning::
    In Lib/site-packages/smart_selects/static/smart_selects/admin/js/chainedfk.js has a problem, all his methods should be defined
    as object so I copy the new js from here:
    `new chainedfk.js <https://github.com/RafaDias/django-smart-selects/blob/61f182f4e56fa7f7eb1ca2fbf0fb922bb25c8a0e/smart_selects/static/smart-selects/admin/js/chainedfk.js>`_

    | And I copy it to my root static project so when I git pull to my production server I have it solved:
    | static/smart-selects/admin/js/chainedfk.js

    And finally into my create.html and edit.html template I import them like this::

        <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'smart-selects/admin/js/chainedfk.js' %}"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'smart-selects/admin/js/chainedm2m.js' %}"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'smart-selects/admin/js/bindfields.js' %}"></script>

My old functionality is from here: `old functionality <https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/01/29/how-to-implement-dependent-or-chained-dropdown-list-with-django.html>`_

django-notify-x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`https://github.com/v1k45/django-notify-x <https://github.com/v1k45/django-notify-x>`_
::

    pip install django-notify-x
    INSTALLED_APPS = ('notify',)
    url(r'^notifications/', include('notify.urls', 'notifications')),
    python manage.py migrate notify
    python manage.py collectstatic

.. warning::
     ``notify`` application has in his models the verb to 50 limit character, just change it to TextField instead of CharField.

About the warning you can do::

    # Lib/site-packages/notify/models.py
    verb = models.TextField(verbose_name=_('Verb of the action'))
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

**Views**::

    from notify.signals import notify
    notify.send(self.request.user, recipient=self.request.user, actor=self.object,
                    verb='subvenci√≥n, %s' % (form.cleaned_data.get('nombre')), obj=self.object,
                    nf_type='create_subvencion')

    Actor: The object which performed the activity.
    Verb: The activity.
    Object: The object on which activity was performed.
    Target: The object where activity was performed.

django-markdown-editor (martor)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
App used to create comments related to each subvencion.
Besides, it allows you to add mentions to users with a custom query and then send them an email.

When you use in template::

    comment.contenido|safe_markdown

This has in ``Lib/site-packages/martor/extensions/mentions.py`` this code:

.. code-block:: python

        def handleMatch(self, m):
        username = self.unescape(m.group(2))

        """Makesure `username` is registered and actived."""
        if MARTOR_ENABLE_CONFIGS['mention'] == 'true':
            if username in [u.username for u in User.objects.exclude(is_active=False)]:
                url = '{0}{1}/'.format(MARTOR_MARKDOWN_BASE_MENTION_URL, username)
                el = markdown.util.etree.Element('a')
                el.set('href', url)
                el.set('class', 'direct-mention-link')
                el.text = markdown.util.AtomicString('@' + username)
                return el

If you leave it like that you will have as many duplicated queries as mentions you have in that template. So to solve this, you just have to comment this line::

    if username in [u.username for u in User.objects.exclude(is_active=False)]:

Project commands
----------------
To start the Python interactive interpreter with Django, using your ``settings/local.py`` settings file::

    python manage.py shell --settings=tarbena.settings.local

To run the local development server with your ``settings/local.py`` settings file::

    python manage.py runserver --settings=tarbena.settings.local

Backup my models::

    python manage.py dumpdata myapp --indent=2 --output=myapp/fixtures/subsidies.json
    python manage.py dumpdata auth --indent=2 --output=myapp/fixtures/auth.json

Load data from those backups::

    python .\manage.py loaddata subsidies.json

Export my production database password and then get it or save it in a secure folder in the production server::

    export MYSQL_PASSWORD=1234
    'PASSWORD': os.getenv('MYSQL_PASSWORD'),
    Or I can add it to my file and import it like the secret key and the email password.



Save my ``SECREY_KEY`` in a secure file in the production server::

    >>> from django.core.signing import Signer
    >>> signer = Signer()
    >>> value = signer.sign('My string')
    >>> value
    'My string:GdMGD6HNQ_qdgxYP8yBZAdAIV1w'

Multiple requirements files
---------------------------
- **base.txt**: place the dependencies used in all environments
- **local.txt**: place the dependencies used in local environment such as debug toolbar
- **production.txt**: place the dependencies used in production environment
- **ci.txt** (continuous integration): the needs of a continuous integration such as django-jenkins or coverage

Admin Documentation
-------------------
`https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/admin/admindocs/ <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/admin/admindocs/>`_

The main branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Master**
- **Develop**

| I consider ``origin/master`` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a ``production-ready state``.

| I consider ``origin/develop`` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Some would call this the ``integration branch``.

.. note::
    | When the source code in the develop branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes should be merged back into ``master`` somehow and then tagged with a release number.

    Therefore, each time when changes are merged back into master, this is a new production release by definition. We tend to be very     strict at this, so that theoretically, we could use a Git hook script to automatically build and roll-out our software to our production servers everytime there was a commit on master.

Supporting branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The different types of branches we may use are:

- **Feature branches**
- **Release branches**
- **Hotfix branches**

Feature branches
""""""""""""""""
| Comes from ``develop`` and must merge back into ``develop``.
| Branch naming convention: anything except ``master``, ``develop``, ``release-*``, or ``hotfix-*``

Feature branches (or sometimes called topic branches) are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that point. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).

| Feature branches typically exist in developer repos only, not in origin.

Creating a feature branch
*************************
::

    $ git checkout -b myfeature develop
    Switched to a new branch "myfeature"

Incorporating a finished feature on develop
*******************************************
::

    $ git checkout develop
    Switched to branch 'develop'

    $ git merge --no-ff myfeature
    Updating ea1b82a..05e9557
    (Summary of changes)

    $ git branch -d myfeature
    Deleted branch myfeature (was 05e9557).

    $ git push origin develop

.. note::
    The ``--no-ff`` flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.

Release branches
""""""""""""""""
| Comes from ``develop`` and must merge back into ``develop`` and ``master``.
| Branch naming convention: ``release-*``

Release branches support preparation of a new production release.

Creating a release branch
*************************
Release branches are created from the develop branch. For example, say version 1.1.5 is the current production release and we have a big release coming up. The state of develop is ready for the ‚Äúnext release‚Äù and we have decided that this will become version 1.2 (rather than 1.1.6 or 2.0). So we branch off and give the release branch a name reflecting the new version number:
::

    $ git checkout -b release-1.2 develop
    Switched to a new branch "release-1.2"

    $ ./bump-version.sh 1.2
    Files modified successfully, version bumped to 1.2.

    $ git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2"
    [release-1.2 74d9424] Bumped version number to 1.2
    1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

After creating a new branch and switching to it, we bump the version number. Here, bump-version.sh is a fictional shell script that changes some files in the working copy to reflect the new version. (This can of course be a manual change‚Äîthe point being that some files change.) Then, the bumped version number is committed.


Finishing a release branch
**************************
When the state of the release branch is ready to become a real release, some actions need to be carried out. First, the release branch is merged into ``master`` (since every commit on ``master`` is a new release by definition, remember). Next, that commit on master must be tagged for easy future reference to this historical version. Finally, the changes made on the release branch need to be merged back into ``develop``, so that future releases also contain these bug fixes.
::

    $ git checkout master
    Switched to branch 'master'

    $ git merge --no-ff release-1.2
    Merge made by recursive.
    (Summary of changes)

    $ git tag -a 1.2

.. note::
    You might as well want to use the -s or -u <key> flags to sign your tag cryptographically.

To keep the changes made in the release branch, we need to merge those back into develop, though. In Git:
::

    $ git checkout develop
    Switched to branch 'develop'

    $ git merge --no-ff release-1.2
    Merge made by recursive.
    (Summary of changes)

This step may well lead to a merge conflict (probably even, since we have changed the version number). If so, fix it and commit.

Now we are really done and the release branch may be removed, since we don‚Äôt need it anymore:
::

    $ git branch -d release-1.2
    Deleted branch release-1.2 (was ff452fe).

Hotfix branches
"""""""""""""""
| Comes from ``master`` and must merge back into ``develop`` and ``master``.
| Branch naming convention: ``hotfix-*``

Hotfix branches are very much like release branches in that they are also meant to prepare for a new production release, albeit unplanned. They arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version. When a critical bug in a production version must be resolved immediately, a hotfix branch may be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.

| The essence is that work of team members (on the ``develop`` branch) can continue, while another person is preparing a quick production fix.

Creating the hotfix branch
**************************
Hotfix branches are created from the master branch. For example, say version 1.2 is the current production release running live and causing troubles due to a severe bug. But changes on develop are yet unstable. We may then branch off a hotfix branch and start fixing the problem:
::

    $ git checkout -b hotfix-1.2.1 master
    Switched to a new branch "hotfix-1.2.1"
    $ ./bump-version.sh 1.2.1
    Files modified successfully, version bumped to 1.2.1.
    $ git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2.1"
    [hotfix-1.2.1 41e61bb] Bumped version number to 1.2.1
    1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

Don‚Äôt forget to bump the version number after branching off!
Then, fix the bug and commit the fix in one or more separate commits.
::

    $ git commit -m "Fixed severe production problem"
    [hotfix-1.2.1 abbe5d6] Fixed severe production problem
    5 files changed, 32 insertions(+), 17 deletions(-)

Finishing a hotfix branch
*************************
When finished, the bugfix needs to be merged back into ``master``, but also needs to be merged back into ``develop``, in order to safeguard that the bugfix is included in the next release as well. This is completely similar to how release branches are finished.

| First, update master and tag the release.

::

    $ git checkout master
    Switched to branch 'master'

    $ git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1
    Merge made by recursive.
    (Summary of changes)

    $ git tag -a 1.2.1

.. note::
    You might as well want to use the -s or -u <key> flags to sign your tag cryptographically.

Next, include the bugfix in develop, too:

::

    $ git checkout develop
    Switched to branch 'develop'

    $ git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1
    Merge made by recursive.
    (Summary of changes)

The one exception to the rule here is that, *when a release branch currently exists, the hotfix changes need to be merged into that release branch, instead of** ``develop``. Back-merging the bugfix into the release branch will eventually result in the bugfix being merged into develop too, when the release branch is finished. (If work in develop immediately requires this bugfix and cannot wait for the release branch to be finished, you may safely merge the bugfix into develop now already as well.)

| Finally, remove the temporary branch:

::

    $ git branch -d hotfix-1.2.1
    Deleted branch hotfix-1.2.1 (was abbe5d6).
