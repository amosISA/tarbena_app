What is the doc directory about?

    Files rst(reStructuredText) to write documentation in plaintext format as an alternative to markdown language.

    Files:

    - deployment.rst
        A point-by-point set of instructions on how to install/update the project into production.

    - installation.rst
        This is really nice for new people coming into a project or when you get a new laptop and need to set up
        the project.

    - architecture.rst
        A guide for understanding what things evolved from as a project ages and grows in scope.

        We recommend pip installing Sphinx systemwide, as youâ€™ll want to have it handy for every Django project.
        What follows are links to the formal reStructuredText specification and a couple sample projects
        which benefit from using it:
