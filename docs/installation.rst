About the app
-------------

| Each Town Hall in small towns needs to be introduced to new technologies. So for my people (TÃ¡rbena/Alicante)
| I have decided to make an application that suits their needs.

| The sole purpose of ``django-notify-x`` is to add a *facebook-like* notification system functionality and give you the ability to control | everything.

**The key features of Tarbena apps are**:

    - Manage subsidies
    - Manage parcels
    - Manage keys that belongs to the Town Hall of Tarbena
    - Add any other app they think can resolve their daily problems
