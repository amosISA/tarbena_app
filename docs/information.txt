What is the doc directory about?

    Files rst(reStructuredText) to write documentation in plaintext format as an alternative to markdown language.

    Files:

    - deployment.rst
        A point-by-point set of instructions on how to install/update the project into production.

    - installation.rst
        This is really nice for new people coming into a project or when you get a new laptop and need to set up
        the project.

    - architecture.rst
        A guide for understanding what things evolved from as a project ages and grows in scope.



    How we render our rst files into pretty design?

        We recommend pip installing Sphinx systemwide, as youâ€™ll want to have it handy for every Django project.
        What follows are links to the formal reStructuredText specification and a couple sample projects
        which benefit from using it:

        Use Sphinx to Generate Documentation From reStructuredText:
        http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html
        https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
        http://sphinx-doc.org/

        Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create beautiful documentation.

        Installing:
            pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild

            Create a directory inside your project to hold your docs:
            cd /path/to/project
            mkdir docs

            cd docs
            sphinx-quickstart
                This command create the sphinx tree inside of our docs directory

            And when we modify our rst just run inside docs the following command to have the pretty
            design inside of our build directory:
                make html (in windows: .\make.bat html)

        Add my docs to readthedocs.io:
            - Create account there
            - Pin project from github and webhook him
            - And we ready to go!
